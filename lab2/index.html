			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>We were asked to create a page with the phrase "Hello world" in big bold letters customized and optimized to our liking. In addition we had to write a small paragraph on said page about our partners.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had some trouble setting up a linkable page that wouldn't delete this one but I fixed it by creating a folder seperate from lab 2.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think it went great. Ari and I work really well together and I learnt a bit about links and certain aspects of html formatting. </p>
