			<h1>Partner Paragraph:</h1>
            <p>We are Ari and Emmet. Emmet is a Computer Science: Game design major, and Ari is a Computer Science major. We both have quite a bit of programming experience and we both have a passion for art which lets us combine our skills really well. This is our second lab together, and so far we are a great team! Shared passions include drawing, programming, and video games. Although we have already worked together twice now we would love to continue to collaborate in the future if permitted. We are a killer team and we cannot wait to show you what we can do together.</p>
