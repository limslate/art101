			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>We were asked to work in groups to document research on different website features and how we think they might be implemented.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We had a little difficulty discerning what to do from the rubric. It was unclear how we were supposed to divide the work amongst ourselves but we got it figured out.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall I think the lab went really well. I really liked my partner and we got the work done on time and with solid effort. </p>
