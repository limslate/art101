					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>I am a computer science and game design major who likes to make art as a hobby!
						I'm excited for this class to refresh my memory on languages I havent used since highschool
						and have a creative outlet. My favorite colors are blue, yellow, and orange and aside from
						CS and art I am passionate about gaming, acting, and singing!
