			<h1>Lab 14: Debugging Tools & Strategies</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>We were tasked to learn more about debugging by debugging our old programs. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>No problems arose in this. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Considering that none of our previous programs had any bugs to note, this was a very very easy lab. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results:</h2>
                     <p>There wasn't anything wrong with my past projects. They all worked as expected and without any bugs, so there wasn't really anything to fix.
						That being said, I did add a few console logs here and there just to get in the habit of it and added code comments to practice proper labeling.
